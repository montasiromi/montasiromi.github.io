      TAKE A LOOK AT THIS WORD CLOUD! This world cloud contain the lyrics of the 
      famous song, <em>"Gangsta's Paradise by Coolio"</em>.
      The Frequency list that was used for this program was built using hashmaps.
      The reason I used hashmaps instead of other data structures like linked lists or arrays
      is becuase the Hashmaps allows me to use a key to determine if i want to increase or decrease 
      a value based on that key. In this case, we increase the value if the key is located.
      The word cloud for this project iwas designed using Maven. The library that I used was 
      <a href=https://github.com/kennycason/kumo">Kumo - Java Word Cloud</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This was definitly a project that helped me gain a bit of experince in areas of computer science
      that I have never really tapped into. However, with more time Iwould definitely like to improve the
      visiual aspect of my word cloud as well as this website.
